# el-paraguas-bot

Bot created for fun trying to learn Python. Don't search for the bot on Telegram because its only allowed in my groups but you can create you own bot and use this code (e.g at the moment we are running using Docker on a Raspberry Pi and it runs well).

## How to deploy on Docker
```bash
$ docker build -t image-name .
$ docker run -it --rm --name container-name image-name
```

## Thanks to all the contributors
